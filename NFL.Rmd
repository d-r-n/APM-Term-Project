## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# rename column
names(MIA_plays)[names(MIA_plays) == "frameId"] <- "frame"
colnames(MIA_plays)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
### pick a play to visualize
play_data <- filter(MIA_plays, playId == "4172") #BAL 4347 (a lot of laterals)

first_frame <- play_data %>%
  filter(event == "ball_snap") %>% 
  distinct(frame) %>% 
  slice_max(frame) %>% 
  pull()

final_frame <- play_data %>% 
  filter(event == "tackle" | event == "touchdown" | event == "out_of_bounds") %>% 
  distinct(frame) %>% 
  slice_max(frame) %>% 
  pull()

first_frame
final_frame
```
```{r echo=TRUE}

  distinct(frame) %>% 
  slice_max(frame) %>%

final_frame <- play_data %>% 
  filter(event == "tackle" | event == "touchdown" | event == "out_of_bounds") %>% 
  distinct(frame) %>% 
  slice_max(frame) %>% 
  pull()

```


```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# plot play frame plot

```

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# plot play frame plot with velocity vectors

```

```
